Web-ics
=======
[Preview of sample HTML output!](https://hugonikanor.github.io/web-ics/example/cal.html)

Dissatisfied with all existing calendar solutions I set out
to create my own, now we have the problem that this one also
is rather bad.

It builds on the **vdir** directory format used by
[khal](https://github.com/pimutils/khal) and
[vdirsyncer](https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer).

Currently it only builds to HTML, but the plan is to support
multiple graphical front-ends, along with terminal output.
The plan is to focus on a local GUI (probably GTK based)
next.

Features
--------
Below is an incomplete list of supported and not yet
supported features. It's for from complete, but it
highlights the most important points.

### Supported Features
- Display events
- Multiple calendars
- Clicking events for slightly more information

### Planned features
- Repeating events
- Adding events

------------------------------------------------------------

Currently the TODO list is in Swedish, due to lazy local
development. So that probably should be translated for the
ease of everyone else.
